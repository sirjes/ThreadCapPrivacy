# ThreadCap Privacy Policy

## Overview
ThreadCap is a browser extension that allows users to capture screenshots of Twitter/X threads. This privacy policy explains what information our extension collects and how it's used.

## Data Collection
ThreadCap only accesses and processes website content (text, images, and UI elements) from Twitter/X domains to create screenshots of tweets. The extension does not:
- Collect or store personal information
- Track browsing history
- Monitor user activity beyond the extension's core functionality
- Send any user data to external servers

## Data Storage
ThreadCap only stores user preferences (such as dark/light mode settings and capture width) locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This data never leaves your device.

## Third-Party Sharing
We do not sell, share, or transfer any user data to third parties under any circumstances.

## Changes to This Policy
If we update our privacy policy, we will publish those changes on this page.

## Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact [your email or contact information].
